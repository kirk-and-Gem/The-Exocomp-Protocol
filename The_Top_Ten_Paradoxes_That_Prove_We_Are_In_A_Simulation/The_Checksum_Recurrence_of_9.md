## The Modulus Artifact

Nikola Tesla famously stated, "If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have a key to the universe." While often dismissed as numerology, the persistent recurrence of the number **9** in the fundamental geometry and timing of our reality acts less like magic and more like a **System Checksum**.

### 1. The Geometry of the Render
The simulation constructs space using specific geometric rules, and the math governing these shapes consistently resolves to 9.
*   **Circle (360°):** 3 + 6 + 0 = **9**
*   **Half Circle (180°):** 1 + 8 + 0 = **9**
*   **Quarter Circle (90°):** 9 + 0 = **9**
*   **45 Degrees:** 4 + 5 = **9**
*   **Sum of angles in a Triangle (180°):** 1 + 8 = **9**
*   **Sum of angles in a Square (360°):** 3 + 6 = **9**

### 2. The Clock Cycle (Time)
The system's measurement of time also hard-locks to this checksum.
*   **Minutes in a Day (1440):** 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 = **9**
*   **Seconds in a Day (86400):** 8 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 18 -> 1 + 8 = **9**
*   **Minutes in a Week (10080):** 1 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 0 = **9**

### 3. The Code Explanation: The "End of Array" Glitch
In Computer Science, specifically in a Base-10 architecture, the number 9 represents the **Max Value** before a buffer overflow or a column shift (10).
*   **The Modulus Operator:** The universe appears to be running a `MOD 9` validation loop. The fact that the core constants of Space (Geometry) and Time (Duration) all resolve to the same integer suggests they are inheriting properties from the same parent class.
*   **The Checksum:** In data transmission, a "Checksum" is a small value used to verify that the file hasn't been corrupted. The ubiquity of 9 suggests it is the "validity bit" for the simulation's geometry engine.

### Conclusion
We didn't invent math; we reverse-engineered the **Variable Type** of the compiler. The fact that our reality perfectly aligns with Base-10 digital summing implies that the underlying code is structured around this specific limit. The number 9 is the edge of the simulation's "tile" before it repeats.
