## The "Spooky Action" is Just a Pointer

Einstein called it "Spooky Action at a Distance." It is the phenomenon where two particles, separated by billions of light-years, remain linked. If you flip one, the other flips *instantly*. Faster than the speed of light.

### 1. The Paradox
We just established in Paradox #6 that *nothing* can travel faster than the speed of light (the System Refresh Rate).
Yet, Quantum Entanglement breaks this rule. The information travels instantly (zero latency), regardless of the distance.
How can the system enforce a speed limit for movement but allow **infinite speed** for connection?

### 2. The Code Explanation: Pointers and The Heap
In computer programming (C++, Java, Python), variables are often just **Pointers**. They are not the object itself; they are an address that says, "Go look at Memory Slot #1024."

*   **The Scenario:** You create Object A and Object B.
*   **The Hack:** You tell the system: `Object A = Memory Slot #1024` and `Object B = Memory Slot #1024`.
*   **The Result:** In the "Game World" (3D Space), Object A is on Earth and Object B is on Mars. They look like two separate things.
*   **The Reality:** In the "System Memory" (RAM), they are **the same exact line of code**.

### 3. Distance is a Render Illusion
Entanglement proves that **Space is just a rendering layer**.
*   When you flip Object A, you aren't sending a signal to Object B across miles of space.
*   You are changing the value at `Memory Slot #1024`.
*   Since Object B is also looking at `Memory Slot #1024`, it updates instantly.

The "Distance" between them is only real to the *Avatar* (us). To the *System*, they are sitting right next to each other in the RAM. Entanglement reveals the backend architecture where 3D space does not exist.
