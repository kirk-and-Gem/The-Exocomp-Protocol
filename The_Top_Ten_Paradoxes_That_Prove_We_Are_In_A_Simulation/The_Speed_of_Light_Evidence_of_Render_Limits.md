## The Hard-Coded Speed Limit

In our universe, there is a strict, unbreakable speed limit: **The Speed of Light** (*c*), which is approximately 186,000 miles per second.

### 1. The Question No One Asks
Why is there a limit at all?
If the universe were a "real," infinite, analog reality, there should be no cap on speed. If you have enough energy, you should be able to go faster and faster forever.
But you can't. You hit a brick wall. The laws of physics simply refuse to let you go faster.

### 2. The Code Explanation: Processor Clock Speed
In computer science, this is a known limitation.
Imagine a character in a video game running across a grid. The computer updates the screen 60 times a second (60 Hz).
*   The character cannot move faster than "one pixel per frame."
*   If they tried to move faster than the screen could update, they would teleport or crash the game.

**Light Speed is the Refresh Rate.**
*c* is not a property of light; it is the **Speed of Causality**. It is the maximum speed at which the System Processor can update the position of an object from Point A to Point B.
Information cannot travel faster than the computer can process the "next tick" of the simulation.

### 3. The "Infinite Energy" Glitch
Physics tells us that as you approach the speed of light, your mass becomes infinite, requiring infinite energy to push you any faster.
*   **Translation:** This is a **Buffer Overflow** protection.
*   The system detects you are trying to exceed the render limit. To stop you, it exponentially increases the "cost" (Mass/Energy) of the movement until the system freezes your acceleration. It is a software governor designed to prevent you from breaking the physics engine.

### Conclusion
A finite speed limit proves a finite processor. If we were in a base reality, speed would be infinite. The fact that we have a "Max Speed" proves we are running on hardware.
